<h2 class="center">Transparency, Accountablity, Collaboration</h2>
<h1>Why I'm standing as a trustee for WBMRT</h1>

<p class="subheading">Tl;dr: I'm Phil, I'm standing as a trustee as I want to try to increase the transparency, accountability and
    collaboration of the team's management.</p>

<p>Hi All,</p>

<p>For those who don't know me; Hi! I'm Phil! My day job is the Lead Software Developer at the Legal Innovation Lab
    Wales, but I also spend a reasonable amount of time working as an outdoor guide, primarily leading groups gorge
    walking in the waterfalls area and coasteering at Rhossili.</p>

<p>I have a few useful qualifications including Rescue3 WRT-Pro, I'm also working towards my RCI and ML. This outdoor
    experience and my day job have given me a wealth of leadership experience.</p>

<p>I joined the team 2 years ago because I wanted to use my skills and experience to help people who needed it most.</p>

<p>This has been an eventful year within the team. It's never an ideal time when trustees and team officers resign and
    EGMs are called. I am not naive enough to think that I can fix everything, but I think I can help, and more than
    anything, I want to try.</p>

<p>If I am elected as a trustee I will aim to increase transparency, accountability and collaboration.</p>
<p>We are a team of volunteers with the shared goal of helping people in need. I feel as though we should share all information openly within the team, by increasing transparency we can increase
    accountability to each other. I think that all information should be easily discoverable by those who want to access
    it. While some personal information will obviously need to remain confidential, I do not feel as though we gain
    anything by siloing information.</p>

<p>As a trustee, I will continue to endeavor to hold true to the principles I follow in life. I will be honest, kind and
    open. I will take ownership of my actions and decisions and aim to leverage the wealth of experience and skills
    around me to improve things for everyone.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this,<br />Best Wishes,</p>
