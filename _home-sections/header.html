        <p class="subheading">I currently work for <a href="https://developer.ryalto.group">Ryalto</a> as the Head of Software Development</p>
        <p>At Ryalto, I <a href=/posts/2022/ryalto-needs-an-upgrade>proposed</a>, architected and led the rebuild of the app. This rebuild took
            Ryalto from an aging microservice architecture on Rails 5 to a modern majestic monolith now running Rails 8, this new app has
            scaled for 40k users and currently runs at 1/10 of the cost of the previous infrastructure. I was responsible for hiring to
            grow the team from 3 to 10. </p>
