        <p>At Ryalto, I <a href=/posts/2022/ryalto-needs-an-upgrade>proposed</a>, architected and led the rebuild of the app. This rebuild
            took Ryalto from an aging microservice architecture on Rails 5 to a modern majestic monolith now running Rails 8, this new app has
            scaled for 40k users and currently runs at 1/10th of the cost of the previous infrastructure. I was responsible for hiring to
            grow the team from 3 to 10. As part of growing the team I put extensive structures in places to increase automation, improve processes and documentation.</p>
        <p> Before this, I led the software development team for the Legal Innovation Lab Wales from 2020 through 2022.
            You can find out more about the lab at <a href="https://legaltech.wales">LegalTech.Wales</a> and find out
            more about my team's work on our <a href="https://developer.legaltech.wales">dev page</a>. A lot of things
            have been cross posted here for posterity.</p>
