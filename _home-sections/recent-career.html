        <p class="center">At Ryalto, I <a href=/posts/2022/ryalto-needs-an-upgrade>proposed</a>, architected and led the rebuild of the app.
            This rebuild
            took Ryalto from an aging microservice architecture on Rails 5 to a modern majestic monolith now running Rails 8 and Hotwire
            with propshaft and import maps. The new app has scaled for 50k users and currently runs at 1/10th of the cost of the previous
            infrastructure. I was responsible for hiring to grow the team from 3 to 10. As part of growing the team I put extensive
            structures in places to increase automation, improve processes and documentation.</p>

        <p>Designed and implemented the majority of the new features, including:</p>
        <ul>

            <li>Instant messaging with Hotwire (Turbo Streams and WebSockets with Action Cable).</li>
            <li>Event booking system.</li>
            <li>Social News Feed and Announcements systems with post creation, reactions, comments and interaction tracking.</li>
            <li>Lightweight bespoke analytics system.</li>
            <li>Admin Dashboard with user controls and granular admin controls to allow customer admins to follow the principle of
                least privilege.
            </li>
            <li>Notifications using the <a href="https://github.com/excid3/noticed/">Noticed Gem</a> (I'm still one of the
                <a href="https://github.com/excid3/noticed/graphs/contributors">top contributors</a> to that Gem).
            </li>
            <li>Automated API Docs using the <a href="https://www.openapis.org/what-is-openapi">OpenAPI</a> standard and
                <a href="https://redocly.com/">Redocly</a>. The docs use the same JSON Schema to test the endpoints and provide examples.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Implemented modernised developer tooling:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Error monitoring with <a href="https://www.honeybadger.io/">Honeybadger</a>.</li>
            <li>Implemented performance monitoring and logging with AppSignal</li>
            <li>Implemented a new CI/CD processes using GitHub Actions and <a href="https://hatchbox.io/">Hatchbox</a> to automated
                deployments to a cluster of workers on Digital Ocean. Responsible for managing and scaling the infrastructure as required.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Worked extensively with partners to design and implement multiple complex cross-platform integrated solutions.</p>
        <p>Implemented the Ryalto Developer page using Jekyll.rb with a
            <a href="https://developer.ryalto.group/features/">detailed feature overview</a>.</p>
        <p>Grew the development team from 4 to 10 members. Led the iterative improvement of existing features, planned and led the
            implementation of other features including Surveys, CSV Import & Export and VoIP Calling.</p>
        <p>Responsibility for management of full dev team, technical budget and tooling payments.</p>


        <hr>
        <p> Before this, I led the software development team for the Legal Innovation Lab Wales from 2020 through 2022.
