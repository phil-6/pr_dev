<h1>Honeymoon</h1>
<p class="subheading">
    Shona and I had the trip of a lifetime to New Zealand for our honeymoon. We spent 3 and a bit weeks travelling around the North and
    South Islands, visiting some of the most incredible places in the world.
</p>
<p>
    We started in Auckland, then headed down to Waitomo via Hamilton and Bridal Veil Falls. After Waitomo, we had a couple of days in Taupo.
    Next we did the Tongariro Alpine Crossing, before heading to Wellington and the South Island. On the South Island we did a three-day
    walk in the Abel Tasman National Park. After all that walking we had a couple of days at a resort in the Milford Sounds. We then
    procceded down South Island via Christchurch and Mount Cook. A couple of days in Wanaka before finishing our trip in Queenstown.
