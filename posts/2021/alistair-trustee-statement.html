<p>Hi everyone, my name’s Ali. I’ve been a member of WBMRT since the start of 2020 and joined the callout list roughly a
    year later. I’m also coming to the end of training as a paramedic and will soon be starting a job with the Welsh
    Ambulance Service. I also freelance as a coasteering guide and outdoor instructor in my spare time. In recent months
    I’ve made use of my medical experience as part of the team’s medical group, developing and updating equipment,
    training and procedures to optimise the care we deliver.</p>

<p>I believe that as a mountain rescue team working alongside the statutory emergency services, we should be aiming to
    hold ourselves to the same standards. Whilst we may be volunteers, as mountain rescuers we enjoy a privileged
    position with the respect of both our 999 colleagues and the wider public. As a trustee, I would hope to foster a
    culture of professionalism within our work, including mutual respect for our fellow volunteers, accountability and
    transparency in the management and organisation of the team, and appropriate standards of behaviour within all team
    activities.</p>

<p>Whilst the recent months have been tumultuous for us, my priority is to focus on the future of the team rather than
    dwelling on the past. I hope to help develop us as a team into a modern, professional rescue service. I welcome any
    thoughts or suggestions anyone in the team may have in relation to me standing as a trustee. I can be contacted by
    my team email below.</p>

<p>Many thanks for your consideration.</p>
