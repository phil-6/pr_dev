<h1>Eilean Shona Adventures</h1>
<p class="subheading"><em>This was written in the guest book in Sawmill Cottage, it's written for the next guests as
    much as for ourselves. I'd strongly recommend that you consider being one of the next visitors to Sawmill Cottage on
    Eilean Shona!</em></p>
<p><em>You can find more information about Eilean Shona on <a href="https://eileanshona.com/">their website.</a></em></p>

<h2>Sunday</h2>
<p>We lost an hour due to the clocks changing, so after a not-actually-that-long lie-in we inflated our paddle boards
    and headed over to the island shop. We must have just missed Jonty and Sarah, but we grabbed some rice (for their
    homemade lamb tagine) and some custard (for the Eve's and sticky toffee puddings) & left a note for Jonty and Sarah.
    We popped into the Village Hall for some internet to check the weather forecast, the tide times and download the OS
    map for the island. Snow is no longer forecast! On the way back we spotted lots of frogs and a newt in the lily
    ponds.</p>

<p>Our after lunch SUP was shorter than originally planned as the tide + wind made progress hard! I did see a crab
    though!</p>
<p>We stashed the SUPs, grabbed a bag and set out along the North Shore path. With some stops to take photos & remove some
    rhododendrons (see the Eilean Shona conservation page), it took us 45 minutes to get to Baramore.</p>

<p class="caption">11 images from our walk along the north shore path from Sawmill to Baramore</p>

<p>After about 30 minutes scrambling on the crags West of Baramore we made it back to the path. We decided to extend our
    walk and headed over the saddle, onto the "Bottom Path". Along with stunning views, we saw our first two deer
    silhouetted against the skyline on the saddle, then four more as we made our way back to Sawmill.</p>

<p>All in, we walked 8.5k in 3h20. We walked in trail shoes but would recommend boots to keep your feet dry through the
    many boggy bits. Make sure you check yourself for ticks!</p>
