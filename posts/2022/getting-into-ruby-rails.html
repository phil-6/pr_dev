<h1>Getting into Ruby on Rails</h1>
<p class="lead">I had a friend message me today, fairly out of the blue, saying this:</p>
<blockquote><p class="lead">“Right, I think I'm sick of mechanical engineering. How do I get into programming and
    software engineering?</p>
    <p class="lead">Can I learn Ruby on Rails myself and get started or should I do a part time course?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="lead">That’s not a small question, and it doesn’t have one answer. There are many, many resources available
    for learning programming, but which ones are good, and where do you start? This is just my opinion on a starting
    direction for someone who has the aim of becoming a Full Stack Ruby Programmer.</p>

<h2>Understand a bit of the landscape</h2>
<p>What is Ruby? What is Rails? What even is this?</p>

<p><a href="https://fireship.io/">Fireship.io</a> is a great resource generally and this video is fantastic. It covers a
    great selection of the basic concepts.</p>

    <span class="small">Good to know about and one that you’ll revisit later</span></p>

<p>Fundamentally, don’t be afraid to google. Asking questions is good, there is a lot of knowledge out
    there and no one knows even close to all of it. There are also a LOT of acronyms and domain specific language (DSLs
    are even a programming thing!). If you don’t know something, google it. Googling well is key to success!</p>

<h2>Find Some Resources</h2>
<p>My speciality is Ruby, so there is definitely going to be a Ruby twist here. There has also been a lot of talk in the
    Ruby community recently which is great, so if you like the idea of getting into Ruby, now is a great time to do
    it.</p>
<p>There are loads of options out there for getting into programming; you can do degrees, you can do boot camps, there
    are online and in person courses, there are a lot of youtube videos and everyone has a different opinion on what’s
    best. The answer, as with almost everything in the software world, is “it depends”. There are lots of different </p>

<p><a href="https://firstrubyfriend.org/">First Ruby Friend</a> is a new mentorship programme and you should definitely
    sign up.</p>

<p>Join <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/">r/learn programming</a> and ignore almost everything on
    there but read their
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq/#wiki_getting_started">getting started guide</a></p>

<h4>Twitter Things</h4>
<p>I've put together a list of pretty great Ruby and Rails accounts that I think are good follows. <a

<h2>Build Something</h2>
<p>While there are a lot of opinions out there for how to get started with coding, programming and software development
    they all agree on one thing. Learning is much easier when you’re trying to build something to solve a problem. Every
    time I’ve followed a tutorial I’ve tried to do my own thing with it, never following it verbatim. While this has
    caused me a load of headaches it has always helped me gain a better understanding of that new piece of technology
    that I’m trying to implement.</p>
<p>Gain experience by building something. My suggestion would be to start with a personal website. It’s a good way to
    start, you can do it with just HTML and CSS. It’s also a great platform to log your experiences and iterate on. </p>
<p>Build it to run locally first, then get it live on the web (Netlify or Cloudflare Pages), then get a custom domain
    (Cloudflare), then get it on a remote code repository (GitHub), then configure automatic deploys when you use Git to
    push your code changes to the remote origin. Don’t worry if all those words don’t make sense to you just yet, they
    will in time. </p>
<p>Once you have your own website, the next challenge is to find something more meaty to build, a bigger problem to
    solve. The first thing I built was a static HTML website (which if you look really hard for you can still find),
    after that I built a Ruby on Rails app to help find and share wild van camping spots. https://VanSpots.uk is still
    alive today and was a great first project. It was a fairly simple CRUD, MVC web app. </p>
<p>Find a problem you want to solve, and start small. Build something simple that works as quickly as possible and
    iteratively, progressively expand and improve it. Remember, you are not alone. There are plenty of people willing
    and able to help.
    <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/buildinpublic">#buildinpublic on twitter</a> has a load of other people
    building things in public (and quite a lot of BS, but it is twitter after all)</p>

<h2>Get Involved</h2>
<p>Finally, get involved with the community. There are strong communities around every aspect of software development.
    Share what you’re doing with your friends or followers. Engage with people who are building things that look
    interesting. Help where you can with open source projects. Ask questions and make suggestions.</p>
<p>Most people will be willing to help and excited to engage. I know I will be!</p>
<p>This is just my thoughts on your starting point. It’s not a short journey, but I really feel as though it will be a
    worthwhile one. If this was helpful or if there is anything that you think I’ve missed please let me know!</p>
