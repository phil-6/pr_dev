<h2>Monday - Written by Shona</h2>
<p class="lead">It's my Birthday!</p>
<p>It started with some hot cross buns we bought from a bakery in Fort William</p>
<p>We'd planned our day around the tides as we wanted to paddleboard to the sandy beach we had spotted yesterday to the
    North of Baramore, Eilean na h-Oitire. As we bought our own boards with us, we set off from our cottage just after
    9. The peace and tranquility was like nothing I've experienced before. After a nice easy float (I mean paddle) with
    the tide, we beached on the island</p>
<p>We explored the small island and found lots of beautiful shells, deer hoof prints, piles of coral, and <strong>then I
    found Phil down on one knee proposing!</strong></p>
<p>Obviously I said YES!</p>

<p>I thought I'd had all my surprises with coming to my own island, but this was the cherry on top.</p>
<p>Once back at the cottage the planning started. Really appreciated the wifi in the Village Hall to call back home and
    tell the family.</p>
<p>Family all told and now time to get back to us time: marshmallows round a campfire before it got too dark and
    cold</p>
