## *Experience*

#### **Developer at Wodboard** 
_April 2025 - Present_

#### **Head of Engineering at Ryalto**
_May 2022 - March 2025_

Led the rebuild of Ryalto, taking it from an  ageing collection of microservices to a modern majestic monolith using  Rails 7 and Hotwire with propshaft and import maps. The new version of  the app scaled to 50000 users at 1/10th of the cost of the previous  infrastructure.

Designed and implemented the majority of the new features, including:
- Instant messaging with Hotwire (Turbo Streams and WebSockets with Action Cable).
- Event booking system.
- Social News Feed and Announcements systems with post creation, reactions, comments and interaction tracking.
- Lightweight bespoke analytics system.
- Admin Dashboard with user controls and granular admin controls to allow customer admins to follow the principle of least privilege.
- Notifications using the Noticed Gem (I'm still one of the top contributors to that Gem).
- Automated API Docs using the OpenAPI standard and Redocly. The docs use the same JSON Schema to test the endpoints and provide examples.

Implemented modernised developer tooling:
- Error monitoring with Honeybadger.
- Performance monitoring and logging with AppSignal
- New CI/CD processes using GitHub Actions and Hatchbox to automate deployments to a cluster of workers on Digital Ocean.

Additional Achievements and Responsibilities
- Responsibility for managing and scaling the infrastructure as required.
- Worked extensively with partners to design and implement multiple complex cross-platform integrated solutions.
- Implemented the Ryalto Developer page using Jekyll.rb with a detailed feature overview.
- Grew the development team from 4 to 10 members.
- Led the iterative improvement of existing features, planned and led the implementation of other features including Surveys, CSV Import & Export and VoIP Calling.
- Responsibility for management of full dev team, technical budget and tooling payments.

#### **Lead Software Developer at Legal Innovation Lab Wales**
_March 2020 - April 2022_

Led the software development team as part of the Legal Innovation Lab Wales project, including:

* Recruitment, onboarding, development and management of team members,
* Creating, developing and evolving all the processes, tooling and infrastructure,
* Developing and delivering 9 different software projects in our first year,

With full responsibility for software development on the project I implemented processes and methodologies that led to an extremely happy and productive team, delivering a wide range of projects which well exceeded all of our aims and targets.  
As I was leading a small team, I had to be involved with every part of every project. Leading the full stack design and development of each project, contributing to the development of many and reviewing code to ensure its quality. I was also responsible for stakeholder engagement, and helped on a broad range of other areas of the project outside of software.  
Primarily used Ruby on Rails deployed via Heroku's PaaS using Cloudflare's CDN and DNS with GitHub for code repos and some CI/CD. Jira was used for task management and Notion for non-project related documentation. Jekyll was also used for our developer pages hosted on Netlify. These were chosen with the aim of ensuring the team's happiness and productivity.
